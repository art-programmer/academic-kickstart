# About Me
I am a fourth-year Ph.D. student in Computer Science and Engineering at Washington University in St. Louis. I am advised by Professor [Yasutaka Furukawa](http://www.cs.sfu.ca/~furukawa/). My research interests include **3D vision** and **scene understanding**. I am particularly interested in geometry reasoning from static images for indoor scenes.
